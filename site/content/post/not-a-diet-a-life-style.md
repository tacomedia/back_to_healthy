If it doesn't end it's a **life style**. You are not making a diet for a specific goal you are changing to healthier life habits that will improve the quality of your life.

If you are able to deeply understand this choice you are recognizing that your previous choices had an unhealthy component, you identify what it was and you are going to change that habit.\

Now you know that you are not going set a goal and once you achieve it go back to your previous behavior, now is a more profound change to change your life forever.
